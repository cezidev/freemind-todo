[![FreeMind TODO - Trello-like TODO list for FreeMind](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ZLzEKCgTwFU/hqdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/ZLzEKCgTwFU)

Description
=========

The satellite program for FreeMind from 2016.
When Trello or Coggle is not enough but still need something simple.
 

What should I do today? What's more interesting for me today? What would I like to do?
It's not a simple TODO list (like in Trello) - some tasks we can to do in parallel and some tasks - only sequentially. For instance, we can simply learn a second language and web-development in parallel. But some things we can do only sequentially. For instance, we can wash dishes only after a lunch :-) 

So we need a simple way to organize it.

The other problem is that's hard to keep your progress if today you want to do web development, tomorrow - learn language and yesterday you just wanted to cook something new. 

And the last problem that I try to solve is: where to keep simple your bookmarks to not forget it in the future?

I think, the most simple way for storing information, keeping progress and so forth - is using a simple mind maps maker. So this utility tries to help you in doing this.
